## Week challenges 11/01/2022

1. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNMy969SjyU) video about compilation and interpretation :white_check_mark:
2. Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted?
:fast_forward: A. Java is a compiled programming language. 
3. Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD
:arrows_counterclockwise: A.  In progress .....
4. Read about Pseudocode [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-pseudocode-in-programming/), you can also find some examples [here](resources/PSEUDOCODE.md)
5. Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful?
:fast_forward: A. It helps to develop algorithms to solve problems using a natural language that is readble for implementation
6. Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)
:arrows_counterclockwise: A.  In progress .....
7. Read about flowcharts [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/es/que-es-un-diagrama-de-flujo)
8. Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?
9. Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vRPOp5p-qs) video

## Week challenges - 12/01/2022

1. Learn about binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers
2. Translate the year you where born to binary, decimal and hexadecimal
3. Translate 51966 into hexadecimal and binary
4. Use a Low-level language, for example MIPS aseembler, to do so, you will need to follow [this](resources/MIPS.md) guide. We recomend to check the guide first but also [this](https://courses.cs.vt.edu/cs2506/Fall2014/Notes/L04.MIPSAssemblyOverview.pdf) presentation could be helpful.
5. Base on the examples and the guide of the low-level language:
   5.1 Create a program to add two numbers given by the user
   5.2 Create a program that display your name
